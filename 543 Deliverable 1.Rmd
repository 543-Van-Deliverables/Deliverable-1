This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Mydata=read.csv("deliverable1.csv")
```


```{r}
names(Mydata)
```


```{r}
str(Mydata, width = 70, strict.width='cut')
```


```{r}
COVIDDF=as.data.frame(table(Mydata$cases))
names(COVIDDF)=c("Covid_Cases","Count")

library(ggplot2)
base1=ggplot(data=COVIDDF, aes(x=Covid_Cases,Count))
bar1=base1+geom_bar(stat = "identity")
bar1
```


```{r}
```


```{r}
```


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
